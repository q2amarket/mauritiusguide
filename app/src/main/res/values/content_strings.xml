    <string name="alexandra_content">The Alexandra Falls viewpoint is highly visited attraction in Mauritius.

From turquoise-blue waters to greenish waters surrounded by a vast area of verdant trees. With a little luck you might spot the monkeys which live there. The huge wall of basalt rocks allow you to discern the formation of this area. As you reach the far corner, you will be mesmerized by the gushing waterfalls, which are simply spectacular.\n\nThe departure point is generally at Trou D’eau Douce as it is the embarkation spot for many excursions leading to Ile aux Cerfs.

    <string name="seven_colors_land_content">The seven colored earth is a natural phenomenon and a prominent tourist attraction. The colors evolved through conversion of basaltic lava to clay minerals.\n\nIt is a relatively small area ofsand dunes comprising sand of seven distinct colours (approximately red, brown, violet, green, blue, purple and yellow).\n\nDue to the tropical weather conditions, all water-soluble elements such as silicon dioxide have been washed out. The remains are the reddish-black iron- and aluminium oxides which create shades in blue, cyan and purple. The various colors developed due to the different compositions.\n\nAnd what is more fascinating is the fact that if you mix the colored earth together, they will eventually settle into separate layers. And you may also be puzzled as the colors might play tricks on you and may appear to be shadows\n\nmillennia, the rocks were pulverized into sands which have the amazing property of settling into distinct layers: if you take a handful of each of the seven different colours of dirt and mix them together, they had eventually separate into a colourful spectrum, each dot of sand rejoining its colour caste\n\nmillennia, the rocks were pulverized into sands which have the amazing property of settling into distinct layers.</string>

He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
